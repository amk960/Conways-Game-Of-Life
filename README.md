# Conways-Game-Of-Life
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
A living cell with two or three neighboring living cells survives into the next generation. 
A living cell with fewer than two living neighbors dies of loneliness.
A living cell with more than three living neighbors will die from overcrowding.
Each empty/dead cell that has exactly three living neighbors--no more, no fewer-- comes to life in the next generation.
